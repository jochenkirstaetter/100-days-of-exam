# Join the [#100DaysOfExam](https://www.100daysofexam.com/) challenge.

## Motivation
Learning is a daily process.  
No matter what we learn constantly and extend our knowledge about the almost everything. Whether it is checking the news during the day, reading a book or watching some videos or TV. Learning is part of our daily life.

This project is all about learning, more precisely the journey to prepare yourself to pass an exam, no matter the nature of the topic. You commit yourself to this 100-day challenge by focusing on a specific topic, by deep diving into it and by preparing yourself to take an exam at the end of term.

In the article [100 Days of Exam](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/100-days-of-exam/) you will find some more background information about this personal growth challenge, and what got me started. Hopefully, it gets you started, too.

1. **Optionally**: Create your log file under `logs` based on your name and send a pull request back to this repository.
1. **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfExam hashtag.**
1. **Important**: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
1. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either add it under `resources` and submit a Pull Request to merge it into this repository, or tweet at me (see info below)
